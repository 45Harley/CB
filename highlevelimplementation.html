    <h1>Implementation</h1>
    
    <h2>Phase 1: Foundation & Awareness</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Public Education: Launch campaigns explaining the purpose of The People's Branch, how it works, and the benefits of citizen-led governance.</li>
        <li>Community Involvement: Gather insights and feedback from diverse groups—including retirees, youth, business leaders, and activists—to refine initial proposals.</li>
        <li>Pilot Programs: Test AI-powered transparency tools in select areas to demonstrate their effectiveness in streamlining government processes and increasing public access to decision-making.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Phase 2: Citizen Engagement & Digital Infrastructure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>AI-Powered Information Portals: Develop platforms where citizens can access simplified government data, track policies, and interact directly with representatives.</li>
        <li>Live Feedback Systems: Deploy AI-driven polls, sentiment analysis, and public consultations so that officials respond to real-time public concerns instead of relying on outdated methods.</li>
        <li>Decision-Making Simulations: AI can present multiple policy options along with projected outcomes, helping both officials and citizens make informed choices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Phase 3: Legislative & Constitutional Integration</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Policy Adoption: Work with lawmakers to incorporate The People's Branch into legal frameworks, ensuring it becomes a permanent part of governance.</li>
        <li>Transparency Mandates: Enforce rules requiring governments to publish all budget details, legislative drafts, and policy discussions in an easily accessible format.</li>
        <li>AI Oversight: Introduce AI-powered audits to prevent corruption, track government spending, and hold officials accountable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Phase 4: Full Implementation & Ongoing Evolution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Real-Time Governance: Citizens actively participate in shaping policies through continuous engagement tools, ensuring decisions reflect public needs.</li>
        <li>Adaptive AI Systems: AI evolves alongside governance, refining processes based on feedback and ensuring efficiency, fairness, and accessibility.</li>
        <li>International Expansion: The model can be adapted for other governments interested in boosting transparency and citizen-driven policy-making.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>By following this structured approach, The People's Branch would shift power from a rigid, bureaucratic system to a dynamic, responsive democracy fueled by technology and citizen engagement.</p>
