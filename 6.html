    <h1>A Constitutional Awakening</h1>
    <p>As The People's Branch grows unstoppable, it demands recognition. Citizens call for a new amendment to solidify its place as the guardian of democracy. Together, they reshape governance—not through revolution, but evolution.</p>
    <p>The constitutional awakening is here. The people reclaim their government, ensuring democracy endures—not as a relic, but as a living promise to every generation.</p>
