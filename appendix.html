<h1>Reimagining Government for the Human Adventure</h1>
 <h1>VISIONING and RESOURCING</h1> 
  <h2>Good Ideas Don't Die Away, Beliefs Do...</h2>
    <p>We need everyone's good ideas. They are the foundation, the architectural drawings of our best concepts of government. In some measure, we have proven that everlasting ideas are foundational. <strong>Justice</strong>, <strong>inalienable rights</strong>—these are examples we already know.</p>

    <h2>The Human Adventure Continues</h2>
    <p>Science, theology, medicine—all have foundational ideas. <strong>Knowing</strong>, <strong>principles</strong>, and <strong>well-being</strong> continue to move us forward. Mistakes, errors, and wrong beliefs divide, stall, and slow our progress.</p>
    <p>Our unity or agreement on good ideas forms the foundation of good government—of good democracy or government by the people.</p>

    <h2>Why Unity?</h2>
    <p>Look at the <em>Jeopardy</em> game program. The three contestants always know more together than any one of them alone. Unity enhances knowledge because it brings together individual insights.</p>
    <p>With the unity of good comes real power. Division destroys. Any perceived power in division has always been self-destructive throughout history, evident in wars and the collapse of nations. The opposite of good is evil. <em>"Divide and conquer"</em> has always had evil beliefs and motives behind it.</p>

    <h2>Good vs. Evil</h2>
    <p>Familiar evils like hate, anger, greed, selfishness, and fear are the opposite of good ideas and actions. These cannot produce good government. Principles or laws of good aim to target and destroy evil.</p>

    <h2>The Adventure</h2>
    <p>James Cook had an amazing adventure in the 18th century. The USA, too, has had an amazing adventure. Hopefully, it can transform itself and continue. Take a break and read about Cook's adventure: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook">James Cook's Biography</a>.</p>
    <p>If you delve into James Cook's history like I did, you may wonder about James T. Kirk and future USA adventures in space, AI, or the universe. Can we call this <em>“Human Advancement”</em>—in science, theology, medicine, and government?</p>

    <h2>New Adventure: Rebuilding Government</h2>
    <p>After all, science, medicine, and even theology have changed dramatically—and are evolving 100 times faster than 250 years ago. It's a testament to our founding fathers that government hasn't changed much, but...</p>

    <h3>Why Change?</h3>
    <p>True progress demands change—not only in science, medicine, and theology, but also in government.</p>

    <h2>Changing Government Ideas</h2>
    <p>Bringing 100 million people along will take time. Expressing ideas may be instant, but absorbing them is not. Here's a proposal:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start building a "relatively simple" system that securely enables verified U.S. citizens to participate according to current voting requirements (federal, state, district, town).</li>
        <li>Enable an online, secure ballot/referenda system compatible with state laws.</li>
        <li>Name the system—perhaps "We the People Supreme Branch."</li>
        <li>Invite volunteer citizen system testers.</li>
        <li>Add the ability for citizens to receive information about and communicate with their representatives easily (messages, eventually video).</li>
        <li>Continue system building, testing, and implementing cycles.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Future Questions to Consider:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>How can this system enable "We the People" to evolve into a more direct democracy?</li>
        <li>What are the future possibilities?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Long-Term Vision</h2>
    <p>Consider the pandemic: vast numbers of people successfully worked from home and attended virtual meetings. Could this suggest that government buildings may become less necessary?</p>
    <p>When AI and robots reach acceptable levels of human interaction, why would we need representatives? Imagine a future where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>AI "representatives" know each individual citizen and gather their opinions on topics.</li>
        <li>Many levels of representation could be bypassed.</li>
        <li>Politicians might resist the implications—no more corruption, no more lies—pure democracy in action.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>An AI Experiment</h2>
    <p>Try this prompt in today's fast-maturing AI world: <em>"Create a list of contrasting good and bad qualities necessary for good government."</em> The response might surprise you—it may even exceed what many representatives could articulate today.</p>
