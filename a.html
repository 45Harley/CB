    <h1>America born again</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning subset of a much larger endeavor to conceptualize and develop a new Branch called "The People's Branch" that reimagines and evolves The US government, instead of using a chainsaw.<p> This sub-project was chosen as a starting point in the conviction that AI and technology will be an underlying component and that technically talented individuals can help discover how to move toward a more direct democratic, effective and efficient form of Government.<p>
The initial expectation is that these technically experienced individuals will create a democratic and progressive approach in the sub-project which will help lay the processses to carry forward.<p>

This "AI-Ethical-Collab" sub-project is an initiative designed to enhance structured discussions through AI-driven facilitation. Our goal is to create an ethical, transparent, and bias-aware AI that interactively participates in collaborating groups - in moderation, in Q&A, consensus-building, and decision-making, rtc. without dominating conversations.</p>
