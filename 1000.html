    <h1>The People's Branch</h1>
    <h2>1. What if democracy had a fourth branch—run directly by the people?</h2>
    <p>The People's Branch is designed to empower citizens with real influence over governance—where transparency, accountability, and public consensus actually shape decisions.</p>

    <h2>2. Who really decides the future of a nation—the government or its citizens?</h2>
    <p>Right now, power is concentrated in traditional branches, but The People's Branch envisions a system where citizens play an active, decisive role in shaping policy, ensuring democracy works for them.</p>

    <h2>3. Could AI help restore democracy and hold leaders accountable?</h2>
    <p>AI has the ability to analyze public sentiment, expose corruption, and keep government transparent—if used ethically, it can be a tool to strengthen democracy rather than threaten it.</p>

    <h2>4. What if YOU had a direct say in how your country is run—every day, not just during elections?</h2>
    <p>The People's Branch aims to create a continuous democratic process, where citizens influence real decisions rather than waiting for election cycles.</p>

    <h2>5. Would you trust a government that is 100% transparent—where every decision is openly tracked?</h2>
    <p>Imagine a system where government actions, budgets, and votes are visible to all—no secrecy, no hidden deals, just full accountability.</p>
