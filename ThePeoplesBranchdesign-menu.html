  <h1>The People's Branch:<p> The Supreme Forth Branch</h1>
  <p><em>A Fourth Branch of Government<p> Direct Citizen Oversight and Participation</em></p> </center>

  <h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>The People's Branch represents a revolutionary approach to democratic governance—a fourth branch of government that provides direct citizen oversight, participation, and accountability mechanisms for the existing three branches. Rather than replacing current structures, it creates the missing accountability layer that restores power to the people.</p>
  <p><strong>Core Principle:</strong> Citizens should have direct, real-time oversight and veto power over government actions that affect their lives.</p>
  <h2 id="problem-analysis">Problem Analysis: Why Government is Broken</h2>

    <li>Public justification required for emergency extension</li>
    <li>Citizen panels evaluate emergency necessity and scope</li>
  </ul>
