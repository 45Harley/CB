    <h1>The Clarity We Govern By</h1>

    <h3>A Public Call for Renewal</h3>
    <p>We gather today not as partisans, not as spectators—but as co-authors of a more perfect union. The fractures we witness across our government—local, state, and federal—are not failures of democracy. They are failures to hear, to heal, to clarify.</p>

    <h3>Truth Without Evasion</h3>
    <p>Let us name the distortions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Systems that favor wealth over wisdom</li>
      <li>Zoning codes that preserve exclusion</li>
      <li>Tax policy shaped behind closed doors</li>
      <li>Healthcare treated as privilege, not principle</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are not technical glitches. They are moral signals. They point to the urgent need for clarity—spiritual, ethical, and procedural.</p>

    <h3>The Vision We Claim</h3>
    <p>Government is not machinery. It is the image of Principle translated into policy. It must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reflect the wholeness of its people</li>
      <li>Respond with humility, not hubris</li>
      <li>Reveal truth in every ledger, ballot, and boundary</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is not radical. It is constitutional fidelity, spiritually magnified.</p>

    <h3>What Begins With Us</h3>
    <p>We do not wait for perfect candidates—we elect principled stewards. We do not accept broken systems—we repair them with our votes, our voices, and our vigilance. This midterm and beyond, let our choices reflect eternal government—just, joyous, and joined.</p>

    <h3>Let Us Govern With Clarity</h3>
    <p>Let love guide our policy. Let transparency silence distortion. Let democracy live—not in slogans, but in every silent budget line, every humble ordinance, every song we sing as a people.</p>
