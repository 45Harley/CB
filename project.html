        <h2>3. Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Our government is and has become paralysed. Rapid advancements in today's society call 
            for changes to our 250-year-old systems of government—local, state, and federal. 
            Technology has the potential to bring improvements across all areas, including speed, 
            transparency, accountability, cost efficiency, individual freedoms, trust, respect, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary focus is on U.S. citizens and voters. The main objective is to empower 
            every citizen to participate easily in democratic governance that serves their needs. 
            Secure Government information, along with past, current, and planned actions, will be 
            tracked and made transparently accessible to each individual. Ideas, opinions, and actions 
            will form the foundation of direct democracy and representative governance.
